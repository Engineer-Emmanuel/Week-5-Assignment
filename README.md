This project contains Python functions demonstrating the use of function definitions, variable handling, conditionals, and thorough documentation using docstrings. The functions are designed to be clear, reusable, and well documented for ease of understanding and maintenance.

Features
Functions with meaningful names performing specific tasks

Use of conditional statements inside functions for flexible behavior

Comprehensive docstrings explaining function purpose, parameters, return values, and exceptions

Example usage demonstrating function calls and expected outputs

How to Use
Import or copy the function(s) into your Python environment or script

Call functions with appropriate arguments as documented in their docstrings

Access function documentation using Python's built-in help() function or .__doc__ attribute for clarification on usage

Docstring Example
python
def sum_subtract(a, b, operation="sum"):
    """
    Return sum or difference between the numbers 'a' and 'b'.

    Parameters:
    a (int or float): First number
    b (int or float): Second number
    operation (str): The operation to perform, either "sum" or "subtract". Defaults to "sum".

    Returns:
    int or float: Result of the operation

    Prints an error message if the operation is unsupported.
    """
    if operation == "sum":
        return a + b
    elif operation == "subtract":
        return a - b
    else:
        print("Incorrect operation.")
Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Project Structure
Single or multiple Python files containing function definitions and docstring documentation
